"""Which books a price may be QUOTED from — the one place that answers it.

A price you cannot take is not a better price. Every board in this repo was
computing "best available number" as the max across the whole multi-book feed,
which is the correct definition for a bettor with accounts everywhere and the
wrong one for this user, who bets FanDuel. The failure is not cosmetic: EV is
computed against the quoted decimal, so a DraftKings +310 next to a FanDuel
+250 produces an EV number, a Kelly stake and a board position that belong to a
bet that cannot be placed. The board then ranks unplaceable rows above placeable
ones, which is worse than not having the row at all.

The split this module enforces:

  QUOTED / EV'd / RANKED   -> BETTABLE books only
  CONSENSUS / FAIR / HOLD  -> every book in the feed

The second half matters as much as the first. Consensus is an estimate of the
true probability, and it gets better the more books it pools — throwing away
Pinnacle's number because you cannot bet Pinnacle would make the fair price
worse for no gain. The same all-books set also has to keep feeding the
line-shop-value and stale-outlier diagnostics, which are statements about the
FIELD, not about your ticket.

Book identifiers arrive in two shapes from The Odds API: bookmakers[].key
("fanduel") in the event endpoints and bookmakers[].title ("FanDuel") in the
odds endpoint nfl_odds.py uses. Both normalize to the same token here, so a
caller never has to know which one it is holding.

Change BETTABLE, not the call sites.
